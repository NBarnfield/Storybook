You stand trembling before Larry, a fierce and majestic creature dressed from mane to tail in a sequin jumpsuit.
Cleary an individual with a flair for the fabulous; a bold attire for a shop keeper you thought.
If you are not careful Larry will convince you to purchase the whole shop!
"I am here to buy a yoga ball for Kranky Krumpet." you remind yourself, not realising that the words have also left your mouth meekly.
"A yoga ball..." Larry murmers, his tone rendering you both exictedly electrified and alarmed.
"I have one, but I must insist that you make a bid."
You steel yourself and stiffen up. You have conquered many foes before, but resisting the two for one sale will be your greatest victory yet.
"How much do you think this incredible, brand new inflated imported yoga ball is worth?"
Despite clearly being used, beaten and patched up, you are an eskimo and Larry was successfully selling you ice.
