possible larry dialogue


As you are about to exchange the money Larry falls over in a dramatic fashion, rigid and clearly in pain.
"My back!" he cries.
You stand concerned and remember the back cracking course you took in cadet school and promptly relive Larry of the pain.
"Thank you!! Please, for you kindness take the ball. I need no payment but my reputation must remain untarnished." he warned.
"If word of this spreads, I promise there will be no merchant that will sell you soy candles again."
With the fear of a thousand dooms you race out of the cave and into the time machine.



Surely Kranky will be happy now.
