After receiving a stale lecture and more information than you would ever need it has become apparent the you need to get Kranky Krumpet a yoga ball so he can stretch out his gluten.
There is only one merchant in the Giggle Galaxy that would stock such a benale item...your most loathed shop keep - Larry the Lion.
After a short flight in the Time Machine you arrive at the Trading Post, a market where goods from across the multiverse collide.
Larry the Lion's cave of curiosities sits on the outskirts of the Trading Post stituated precariously between Barbarra's Hat Harem, and Candice's Candied Capers.
You tremble as you approach the cave, breathing shallow breaths.
In, and out.
In, and out.
You do not tremble because Larry the Lion is scary, quite the opposite in fact.
Larry is the most charismatic constituent of the Giggle Galaxy, and if there is a bargin to be had or a profit to be made Larry is sure to be involved.
"I can do this" you say to yourself. "All I need is a yoga ball", an affirmation you repeat under your breath hoping it will prevent you from purchasing a soy candle and rose water soap.
Undoubtably smelling weakness and waivering self-control, Larry leaps from out of the darkness and approaches with eyes ablaze.
Lions can sense fear, and Larry was ready to pounce on his prey.
